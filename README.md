# Parkinson's Disease Predictor - SVM Model

This repository contains a Parkinson's disease predictor that utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the underlying machine learning model. The goal of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate system that can assist in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease based on given input features.

# Dataset
The SVM model is trained on a dataset that consists of various features extracted from voice recordings of individuals with and without Parkinson's disease.

# Prerequisites
To run the Parkinson's disease predictor, you need the following dependencies:

Python (version 3.6 or later)
scikit-learn library (version 0.24.2 or later)
numpy library (version 1.19.5 or later)
pandas library (version 1.2.4 or later)
You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

"pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas"
