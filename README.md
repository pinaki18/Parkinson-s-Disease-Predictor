Parkinson's Disease Predictor - SVM Model
This repository contains a Parkinson's disease predictor that utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the underlying machine learning model. The goal of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate system that can assist in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease based on given input features.

Dataset
The SVM model is trained on a dataset that consists of various features extracted from voice recordings of individuals with and without Parkinson's disease. The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain the dataset from the original source or any other reliable data repository.

Prerequisites
To run the Parkinson's disease predictor, you need the following dependencies:

Python (version 3.6 or later)
scikit-learn library (version 0.24.2 or later)
numpy library (version 1.19.5 or later)
pandas library (version 1.2.4 or later)
You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas
